# Geospatial Django Application

This is an ongoing project for my band's upcoming EP release "Half a World Away"! The idea being that this is a visual representation of what city is on the other side of the world from you right now. I had a lot of fun developing the backend and working with Three.js to create an interactable globe for this project. 

The next steps are to implement the Spotify API to create a playlist of songs from "Half a World Away". Thanks for checking it out!
